# TODO: Patchwork Issues and Improvements

## ~~Critical Issues~~ ✅ RESOLVED

### 1. ~~Double Clutch Mode (Request-Responder)~~ - FIXED ✅
**Status**: Fixed and working correctly (August 30, 2025)

**Resolution**: The issue was fixed by correcting the `handleResponderSwitch()` function to properly send the request data to the responder (not just headers). The key changes were:

1. **Fixed request data delivery**: The responder now receives the actual request body, not just a success message
2. **Improved error handling**: Added timeout error responses and better validation
3. **Added comprehensive tests**: Created tests for the complete double clutch flow including timeout scenarios
4. **Updated documentation**: Fixed examples in both README.md and assets/index.html

**Changes Made**:
- `main.go` - Fixed `handleResponderSwitch()` to use `io.Copy()` to send request data to responder
- `main.go` - Added timeout error response to requester when no response is received on switched channel
- `main.go` - Added validation for channel ID format
- `main_test.go` - Added comprehensive test for complete double clutch flow
- `main_test.go` - Added test for timeout handling
- Updated documentation with correct examples

**Testing Status**: 
- All tests pass including new comprehensive tests
- Manual testing confirms double clutch mode works correctly
- Created `test_double_clutch_working.sh` for manual verification

## ~~Documentation Updates~~ ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. ~~Update Documentation~~ ✅
- [x] Fixed examples in `assets/index.html` to reflect working protocol
- [x] Updated `README.md` with correct double clutch usage
- [x] Examples now show the complete flow with proper explanations

## ~~Cleanup~~ ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. ~~Test Scripts~~ ✅
All temporary test scripts have been removed. Only kept:
- `test_double_clutch_working.sh` - A working test script for manual verification

### 2. ~~Log Files~~ ✅
No temporary log files found - already cleaned up

## ~~Testing Strategy~~ ✅ RESOLVED

### 1. ~~Manual Testing Approach~~ ✅
Created `test_double_clutch_working.sh` that properly handles:
- Background processes with proper PIDs
- Timeout commands for all requests
- Clear output with color coding
- Proper cleanup

### 2. ~~Automated Testing~~ ✅
- Added comprehensive tests in `main_test.go`
- Tests now verify complete request-response flows
- Added test for double clutch mode end-to-end
- Added test for timeout error handling
- All tests pass successfully

## ~~Performance and Reliability~~ ✅ IMPROVED

### 1. ~~Timeout Handling~~ ✅
- Timeout for double clutch mode set to 30 seconds
- Added proper timeout error response (504 Gateway Timeout) sent to requester
- Graceful handling of timeout scenarios with proper cleanup

### 2. ~~Resource Management~~ ✅
- Fixed proper cleanup of channels and goroutines
- Ensured streams are closed properly in all cases
- Added error logging for resource cleanup failures

## ~~Future Enhancements~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ~~Error Handling~~ ✅
- Added detailed error messages for double clutch failures
- Timeout errors are properly propagated to the requester
- Added validation for channel ID format
- Clear error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 2. ~~Monitoring and Debugging~~ ✅
- Added detailed logging throughout double clutch flow
- Log messages include channel IDs, timeouts, and client IPs
- Clear indication of success/failure at each step



## Summary

All critical issues have been resolved! The double clutch mode is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Correct request/response forwarding
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Timeout management with proper error responses
- ✅ Full test coverage
- ✅ Updated documentation
- ✅ Clean codebase with no temporary files
